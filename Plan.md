# &#x20;Team Walkthrough Template (Interview & Observation)

Purpose of this document:
To collect a realistic, ground-level understanding of how teams work, identify bottlenecks and recurring pain points, **without proposing solutions at this stage**.

---

## 1. Basic Information

* Team name:
* Area of responsibility:
* Key roles in the team:
* Interviewees:
* Date:

---

## 2. Day-to-Day Workflow (How work actually happens)

Objective: Understand flow, not judge quality.

Guiding questions:

* What does a typical workday look like for the team?
* Which tasks consume the most time?
* What tools are used on a daily basis?
* Where does frequent context switching occur (tools, people, systems)?

## Observations:

*

---

## 3. Pain Point Identification

Objective: Identify friction, not propose AI.

Guiding questions:

* What is the most frustrating part of your work?
* Where do you feel you invest a lot of effort for limited value?
* Which tasks are repetitive or manual?
* Where do dependencies on others slow you down?

## Identified pain points:

*

---

## 4. Repetitive Cognitive Work

Objective: Detect potential AI fit areas.

Guiding questions:

* Where do you repeatedly analyze, write, summarize, or compare similar information?
* Which decisions require gathering and processing large amounts of context?
* Where is there frequent copy-paste, rewriting, or reformatting?

## Examples:

*

---

## 5. Quality, Risk, and Compliance

Objective: Understand where mistakes are unacceptable.

Guiding questions:

* Where is it critical not to make mistakes?
* Which processes are highly sensitive or regulated?
* What requires full human review and approval?

## Notes:

---

## 6. Current Measurement (Baseline)

Objective: Enable before/after comparison.

Guiding questions:

* How do you currently measure success or efficiency?
* Which activities take the longest?
* Where is the clearest bottleneck today?

## Existing metrics:

---

## 7. Observation Summary (No Solutions)

## Primary pain:

Frequency:

* Daily / Weekly / Per sprint / Ad-hoc

Impact:

* Low / Medium / High

## Other stakeholders involved:

---

## 8. AI Tech Lead Internal Notes (Not for sharing)

## Initial reflections (no actions yet):

Initial classification:

* Suitable for AI enablement
* Suitable for process improvement
* Not a priority at this stage

### Ground rules for using this template

* No solutions
* No technologies
* No proofs of concept

Focus on listening, documenting, and clarifying reality
